## Simple Analysis:Basic SQL queries are used to retrieve data, such as:
*What are the details of all laptops in the product table?*  
*What are the names and addresses of orders delivered on 2017-02-17?*  
*What are the comments for product 1?*  
*How can I insert the user ID of sellers whose name starts with 'A' into the buyer table?*  
*What is the total quantity of products from store ID 8 in the shopping cart?*  
*How can I update the payment state of orders to 'Unpaid' for orders created after 2017 with a total amount greater than 50?*  
*How can I update the name and contact phone number for addresses in Maharashtra and Mumbai?*  
*How can I delete the stores that opened before 2015 from the shopping cart?*  
*How can I list all users with their associated address information?*
